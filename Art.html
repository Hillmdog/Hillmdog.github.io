		<h1>My Art Gallery</h1>
			<p id="p">I always loved to draw and make arts and crafts growing up.
			as I got older, I started taking art electives in school and spent more
			 time out of class working on my craft. In highschool, I took 4 years of
		  art, with my last two being honors art. There was only one other person
		in the class. His name was Darrian. Becuase of this, we had alot of freeway
	 in what we did for assiegments. Here are some of my pieces and a short Story
 on each.</p>

      <h3>Lux</h3>
      <p>Lux was a piece I created my junior year. It was created for 100 neediest
				cases. It is a pen hatched  piece with water color piece and white charcoal
				dusting. The missing piece is found on the lower left corner meant to represent
				the missing link we all need.</p>

    <img src="art6.jpg" alt="Unnamed" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Unnamed</h3>
      <p>I drew this artwork my freshman year at UW. I was studying at Fetzer
				and wanted to take a study break. There is no meaning, more just a doodle.</p><br><br><br>

    <img src="art3.jpg" alt="Auxilium" style="width:100%">
      <h3>Auxilium</h3>
      <p>Auxilium was one of my senoir projects. It is a full charcoal piece created
				for 100 needies cases. It was selected and published alongside a sotry.
				The piece is meant to represent how people are often walled off and seperated
				and must climb to be set free.</p>

				<h3>De Smet</h3>
				<p>This work was a collab with three other people. We created it for the De Smet auction and
					ended up selling for a little over 100$. It is a full acrylic poured piece
					with hand panted spartan helm and letters. The brim was poured in acrylic
					and is covered in a clear layer. </p>

	    <img src="art5.jpg" alt="Pennywise" style="width:100%">
	      <h3>Pennywise</h3>
	      <p>Pennywise was my final project my senoir year. I spent over 30 hours working
					on him and ended running out of time. He is a 3X4 foor charcoal portrait.
					I hope to one day finish him and display him in my house. </p>
